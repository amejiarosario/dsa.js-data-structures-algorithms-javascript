(((Merge Sort)))
Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses <<Divide and Conquer, divide and conquer>> paradigm to accomplish its task faster. However, It uses auxiliary memory in the process of sorting.

indexterm:[Divide and Conquer]
Merge sort algorithm splits the array into halves until 2 or fewer elements are left. It sorts these two elements and then merges back all halves until the whole collection is sorted.

== Merge Sort Implementation

.Merge Sort implementation in JavaScript (mergeSort)
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort.js[tag=sort, indent=0]
----
<1> Convert any kind of iterable (array, sets, etc.) into an array

As you can see this function is just a wrapper to transform things into an array. The heavy lifting is done in `splitSort` as you can see below.

<1> Base case: Sort two or less items manually.
<2> Recursively divide the array in half until two or less elements are left.
<3> Merge back the sorted halves in ascending order.

Let's take a look at the merge function:

<1> We need to keep track of 3 arrays indices: `index` which keeps track of the combined array position, `i1` which is the `array1` index and `a2` for `array2`.
<2> If `array1` current element (`i1`) has the lowest value, we insert it into the `mergedArray` if not we then insert `array2` element.
<3> `mergedArray` is `array1` and `array2` combined in ascending order (sorted).

Merge sort has an _O(n log n)_  running time. For more details about how to extract the runtime go to <<Linearithmic>> section.

== Merge Sort Properties

- <<Stable>>: [big]#✅# Yes
- <<In-place>>: [big]#️❌# No, it requires auxiliary memory O(n).
- <<Online>>: [big]#️❌# No, new elements will require to sort the whole array.
- <<Adaptive>>: [big]#️❌# No, mostly sorted array takes the same time O(n log n).
- Recursive: Yes
- Time Complexity: [big]#✅# <<Linearithmic>> _O(n log n)_
- Space Complexity: [big]#⚠️# <<Linear>> _O(n)_, use auxiliary memory
