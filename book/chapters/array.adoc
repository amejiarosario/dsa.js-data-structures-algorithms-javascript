= Array
(((Array)))
(((Data Structures, Linear, Array)))
Arrays are one of the most used data structures. You probably have used it a lot but are you aware of the runtimes of  `splice`, `shift`, `indexOf`  and other operations? In this chapter, we are going deeper into the most common operations and their runtimes.

== Array  Basics

An array is a collection of things (strings, characters, numbers, objects, etc.). They can be many or zero.

TIP: Strings are a collection of Unicode characters and most of the array concepts apply to them.

.Fixed vs. Dynamic Size Arrays
****
Some programming languages have fixed size arrays like Java and C++. Fixed size arrays might be a hassle when your collection gets full, and you have to create a new one with a bigger size. For that, those programming languages also have built-in dynamic arrays: we have `vector` in C++ and `ArrayList` in Java. Dynamic programming languages like JavaScript, Ruby, Python use dynamic arrays by default.
****

Arrays look like this:

.Array representation: each value is accessed through an index.

Arrays are a sequential collection of elements that can be accessed randomly using an index. Let’s take a look into the different operations that we can do with arrays.

== Insertion

Arrays are built-in into most languages. Inserting an element is simple; you can either add them on creation time or after initialization. Below you can find an example for both cases:

.Inserting elements into an array
[source, javascript]
----
// (1) Add elements at the creation time:
const array = [2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7];

// (2) initialize the array (empty) and values later
const array0 = [];
array0[2] = 1;
----

Using the index, you can replace whatever value you want. The runtime is constant: _O(1)_.

=== Inserting at the beginning of the array

What if you want to insert a new element at the beginning of the array? You would have to push every item to the right.

.Insert to head
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7];
array.unshift(0); // ↪️ 8
// array: [0, 2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7]
----

As you can see, `2` was the index 0, now was pushed to index 1, and everything else was moved one place. `unshift` takes *O(n)* since it affects all the elements in the array.

.JavaScript built-in `array.unshift`
****
The `unshift()` method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

Runtime: O(n).
****

=== Inserting at the middle of the array

Inserting a new element in the middle involves moving part of the array but not all of the items.

.Inserting element in the middle
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7];
array.splice(1, 0, 111); // ↪️ [] <1>
// array: [2, 111, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7]
----
<1> at the position `1`, delete `0` elements and insert `111`.

The Big O for this operation would be *O(n)* since in worst case it would move most of the elements to the right.

.JavaScript built-in `array.splice`
****
The `splice()` method changes the contents of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements.  Returns an array containing the deleted elements.

Runtime: O(n).
****

=== Inserting at the end of the array

We can push new values to the end of the array like this:

.Insert to tail
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7];
array.push(4); // ↪️ 7 <1>
// array: [2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7, 4]
----
<1> The `4` element would be pushed to the end of the array. Notice that `push` returns the new length of the array.

Adding to the tail of the array doesn’t change other indexes. E.g., element 2 is still at index 0. So, this is a constant time operation *O(1)*.

.JavaScript built-in `array.push`
****
The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

Runtime: O(1).
****

== Searching by value and index

Searching by index is very easy using the `[]` operator:

.Search by index
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7];
array[4]; // ↪️ 6
----

Searching by index takes a constant time, *O(1)*, to retrieve values out of the array. If we want to get fancier we can create a function:

// image:image17.png[image,width=528,height=293]

.Search by index
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/arrays/array.js[tag=searchByIndex]
----

Finding out if a value is in the array or not is a different story.

// image:image18.png[image,width=528,height=338]

.Search by value
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/arrays/array.js[tag=searchByValue]
----

We would have to loop through the whole array (worst case) or until we find it: *O(n)*.

== Deletion

Deleting (similar to insertion) there are three possible scenarios, removing at the beginning, middle or end.

=== Deleting element from the beginning

Deleting from the beginning can be done using the `splice` function and also the `shift`. For simplicity, we will use the latter.

.Deleting from the beginning of the array.
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [2, 111, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7];
// Deleting from the beginning of the array.
array.shift(); // ↪️2
array.shift(); // ↪️111
// array: [5, 1, 9, 6, 7]
----

As expected, this will change every index, so this takes *O(n)*.

.JavaScript built-in array.shift
****
The `shift()` method shift all elements to the left. In turn, it removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array.

Runtime: O(n).
****

=== Deleting element from the middle

We can use the `splice` method for deleting an item from the middle of an array.

.Deleting from the middle
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
// Deleting from the middle
array.splice(2, 1); // ↪️[2] <1>
// array: [0, 1, 3, 4]
----
<1> delete 1 element at position 2

Deleting from the middle might cause most the elements of the array to move back one position to fill in for the eliminated item. Thus, runtime: O(n).

=== Deleting element from the end

Removing the last element is very straightforward:

.Deleting last element from the array
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [2, 5, 1, 9, 111];
array.pop();  // ↪️111
// array: [2, 5, 1, 9, 111]
----

No element other element has been shifted, so it’s an _O(1)_ runtime.

.JavaScript built-in `array.pop`
****
The `pop()` method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.

Runtime: O(1).
****

== Array Complexity

To sum up, the time complexity on an array is:
