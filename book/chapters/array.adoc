= Array

Arrays in one of the most used data structure. It’s a collection of things (strings, characters, numbers, objects, etc.). They can be many or zero. Strings are a collection of Unicode characters and most of the array concepts apply to them.

.Fixed vs Dynamic Size Arrays
****
Some programming languages has fixed size arrays like Java and C++. Fixed size arrays might be wasteful when you array gets filled and you have to create a new one with bigger size. For that, those programming languages also have built-in dynamic arrays: we have `vector` in C++ and `ArrayList` in Java. Dynamic programming languages like JavaScript, Ruby, Python use dynamic arrays by default.

Arrays look like this:

.Array representation: each value is accessed through an index.

Arrays are a sequential collection of elements that can be accessed randomly using an index. Let’s take a look into the different operations that we can do with arrays.

== Insertion

Arrays are built-in into most languages. Inserting element in an array is you can either:

.Inserting elements into an array
[source, javascript]
----
// (1) Add elements at the creation time:
const array = [2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7];

// (2) initialize the array (empty) and values later
const array0 = [];
array0[2] = 1;
----

Using the index, you would replace whatever value was there.

=== Inserting at the beginning of the array

What if you want to insert a new element at the beginning of the array? You would have to push every element to the right.

.Insert to head
[source, javascript]
----
array.unshift(0); //=> [0, 2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7]
----

As you can see 2 was the index 0, now was pushed to index 1, and everything else was pushed out. This takes *O(n)* since it affects all the elements in the array.

.JavaScript built-in `array.unshift`
****
The `unshift()` method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array. Runtime: O(n).
****

=== Inserting at the middle of the array

Inserting a new element in the middle involves moving part of the array but not all of the items.

.Inserting element in the middle
[source, javascript]
----
array.splice(1, 0, 111); // <1>
----
<1> at the position 1, delete 0 elements and insert 111. The array would be `[2, 111, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7]`

The Big O for this operation would be *O(n)*, since in worst case it would move most of the elements to the right.

.JavaScript built-in `array.splice`
****
The `splice()` method changes the contents of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements. Runtime: O(n).
****

=== Inserting at the end of the array

We can push new values to the end of the array like this:

.Insert to tail
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7];
array.push(4); // <1>
----
<1> The `4` element would be pushed to the end `[2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7, 4]`.

Adding to the tail of the array doesn’t change other indexes. E.g. element 2 is still at index 0. So, this is a constant time operation *O(1)*.

.JavaScript built-in `array.push`
****
The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. Runtime: O(1).
****

== Searching by value and index

Searching by index is very easy using the `[]` operator:

.Search by index
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 7];
array[4]; //↪️ 6
----

This is takes a constant time, *O(1)*, to retrieve values out of the array. If we want to get fancier we can create a function:

// image:image17.png[image,width=528,height=293]

.Search by index
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/arrays/array.js[tag=searchByIndex]
----

Finding out if an element is in the array or not is a different story.

// image:image18.png[image,width=528,height=338]

.Search by value
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/arrays/array.js[tag=searchByValue]
----

We would have to loop through the whole array (worst case) or until we find it. This takes *O(n)*.

== Deletion

Deleting like insertion there are three possible scenarios, deleting at the beginning, middle or end.

=== Deleting element from the beginning

Deleting from beginning can be done using the splice funtion and also the shift. Let’s use the latter since it’s simpler:

.Deleting from the beginning of the array.
[source, javascript]
----
array.shift(); //=> [5, 1, 9, 6, 7]
----

As expected, this will make every index to change, so this takes *O(n)*.

.JavaScript built-in array.shift
****
The `shift()` method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array. Runtime: O(n).
****


=== Deleting element from the middle

We can use the splice operator for this

.Deleting from the middle
[source, javascript]
----
array.splice(2, 1); // delete 1 element at position 2
// => array: [2, 5, 9, 6, 7]
----

This might cause most the elements of the array to move and occupied the deleted position. Thus, runtime: O(n).

=== Deleting element from the end

Removing the last element is very straightforward:

.Deleting last element from the array
[source, javascript]
----
array.pop(); // => array: [2, 5, 1, 9, 6]
----

No element other element has be shifted so it’s a O(1) runtime.

.JavaScript built-in `array.pop`
****
The `pop()` method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array. Runtime: O(1).
****

== Array Complexity

To sum up, the time complexity on an array is:

.Time complexity of array operations

.2+.^s| Data Structure 2+^s| Searching By 3+^s| Inserting at the 3+^s| Deleting from .2+.^s| Space Complexity
|_Index/Key_ |_Value_ |_beginning_ |_middle_ |_end_ |_beginning_ |_middle_ |_end_
