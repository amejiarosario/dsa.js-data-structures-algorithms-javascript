Data Structures comes in many flavors. There’s no one to rule them all. You have to know the tradeoffs so you can choose the right one for the job.

Even though in your day-to-day, you might not need to re-implementing them, knowing how they work internally would help you how when to use over the other or even tweak them to create a new one. We are going to explore the most common data structures time and space complexity.

.In this part we are going to learn about the following linear data structures:
- <<Array>>
- <<Linked List>>
- <<Stack>>
- <<Queue>>

Later, in the next part, we are going to explore non-linear data structures like <<Graph, Graphs>> and <<Tree, Trees>>.
