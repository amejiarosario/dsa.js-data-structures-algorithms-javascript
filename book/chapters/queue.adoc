= Queue

A queue is a linear data structure where the data flows in a *First-In-First-Out* (FIFO) manner.

.Queue data structure is like a line of people: the First-in, is the First-out

A queue is like a line of people at the bank, the person that arrived first is the first to go out as well.

Similar to the stack, we only have two operations (insert and remove). In a Queue, we add elements to the back of the list and remove it from the front.

We could use an array or a linked list to implement a Queue. However, it is recommended only to use a linked list. Why? An array has a linear runtime _O(n)_ to remove an element from the start while a linked list has constant time _O(1)_.

.Queue's constructor
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/queues/queue.js[tag=constructor]
  // ... methods goes here ...
}
----

We initialize the Queue creating a linked list. Now, let’s add the `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods.

== Insertion

For inserting elements on queue, also know as *enqueue*, we add items to the back of the list using `addLast`:

.Queue's enqueue
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/queues/queue.js[tag=enqueue, indent=0]
----

As discussed, this operation has a constant runtime.

== Deletion

For removing elements from a queue, also know as *dequeue*, we remove elements from the front of the list using `removeFirst`:

.Queue's dequeue
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/queues/queue.js[tag=dequeue, indent=0]
----

As discussed, this operation has a constant runtime.

== Implementation usage

We can use our Queue class like follows:

.Queue usage example
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/queues/queue.js[tag=snippet, indent=0]
----

You can see that the items are dequeue in the same order they were added, FIFO (first-in, first out).

== Queue Complexity

As an experiment, we can see in the following table that if we had implemented the Queue using an array, its enqueue time would be _O(n)_ instead of _O(1)_. Check it out:

= Summary

In this chapter, we explored the most used linear data structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues. We implemented them and discussed the runtime of their operations.

To sum up,

.Use Arrays when…
* You need to access data in random order fast (using an index).
* Your data is multi-dimensional (e.g., matrix, tensor).

.Use Linked Lists when:
* You will access your data sequentially.
* You want to save memory and only allocate memory as you need it.
* You want constant time to remove/add from extremes of the list.

.Use a Queue when:
* You need to access your data in a first-come, first served basis (FIFO).
* You need to implement a <<Breadth-First Search for Binary Tree, Breadth-First Search>>

.Use a Stack when:
* You need to access your data as last-in, first-out (LIFO).
* You need to implement a <<Depth-First Search for Binary Tree, Depth-First Search>>
