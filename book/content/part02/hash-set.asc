(((Set))) (((Data Structures, Non-Linear, Set)))
[[hash-set-chap]]
=== Set
Set is a data structure that allows you to store unique values. If you try to add the same value, multiple times only one instance will be added. Also, you can check very quickly if a value exists or not. Searching by value on arrays takes `O(n)`. However, searching by value on a Set takes `O(1)` on average.

A Set can be implemented on different ways. One way it's using a <<hashmap-chap, Hash Map>> and other is using a <<tree-map-chap, Tree Map>>. JavaScript has a built-in Hash Set, so that' the one we are going to focus on.

TIP: We will go more in details with <<tree-map-chap, Tree Map>> after we cover the <<binary-search-tree-chap>>.


==== Set vs Array

An array allows you to search a value by index in constant time `O(1)`, however if you don't know the index, searching a value would take you linear time `O(n)`. A Set has doesn't allow you to search value by index, but you can search by value in constant time. The `Set.add` and `Set.has` method both are `O(1)` in average.

Take a look at the following examples:

.Set usage example (using JavaScript built-in Set)
[source, javascript]
----
const set = new Set();

set.add(1); //↪️ Set [ 1 ]
set.add(1); //↪️ Set [ 1 ]
set.add(2); //↪️ Set [ 1, 2 ]
set.add(3); //↪️ Set [ 1, 2, 3 ]
set.has(1); //↪️ true
set.delete(1); //↪️ removes 1 from the set
set.has(1);    //↪️ false, 1 has been removed
set.size; //↪️ 2, we just removed one value
console.log(set); //↪️ Set(2) {2, 3}
----

As you can see, even if we insert the same value multiple times, it only gets added once.

Similar to a <<hashmap-examples, map>>, you can also insert objects and any kind of objects. However, be careful, because anything that is not a number, string or symbol would be matched by reference. Let's do some examples.

.Using a Set with objects
[source, javascript]
----
const set = new Set();

set.add({a: 1, b: 2});
set.has({a: 1, b: 2}); // ↪️ false

const a = {a: 1, b: 2};
set.add(a);
set.has(a); // ↪️ true

console.log(set); // Set { [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
----

As you can see, you can't to find object using a new object (e.g. `{a: 1, b: 2}`), you need the reference to find it.
If you need to match by value, you would need to convert it to an string using `JSON.stringify`.

.Workaround to find objects by value.
[source, javascript]
----
const set = new Set();

set.add(JSON.stringify({a: 1, b: 2}));

set.has(JSON.stringify({a: 1, b: 2})); // ↪️ true

console.log(set); // Set { '{"a":1,"b":2}' }
----


==== Removing duplicates from an array.

One common case for a Set is to eliminate duplicates from an array.

.Removing duplicates from an array
[source, javascript]
----
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2];

// convert array to set
const set = new Set(arr);
// convert set to array
const uniqueValues = Array.from(set);
// check array
console.log(uniqueValues); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
----

You can also do it all in one line.

.One-liner to remove duplicates from array.
[source, javascript]
----
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2];
console.log([...new Set(arr)]); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
----

==== Time Complexity of a Hash Set

All operation on Hash Set are constant time on average: `O(1)`. Similar to the Hash Map, there are cases when the the Set is getting full and it would do a rehash taking `O(n)` for that one insertion.

// tag::table[]
.Time complexity HashSet
|===
.2+.^s| Data Structure 2+^s| Searching By .2+^.^s| Insert .2+^.^s| Delete .2+^.^s| Space Complexity
^|_Index/Key_ ^|_Value_
| Hash Set ^|O(1) ^|- ^|O(1)* ^|O(1) ^|O(n)
|===
{empty}* = Amortized run time. E.g. rehashing might affect run time to *O(n)*.

==== Practice Questions
(((Interview Questions, Set)))

// tag::set-q-most-common-word[]
===== Most common word

*ST-1*) _Given a text and a list of banned words.
Find the most common word that is not on the banned list.
You might need to sanitize the text and strip out punctuation `?!,'.`_
// end::set-q-most-common-word[]

// _Seen in interviews at: Amazon._

Examples:

[source, javascript]
----
mostCommonWord(
  `How much wood, would a Woodchuck chuck,
  if a woodchuck could chuck?`,
  ['a'],
); // woodchuck or chuck (both show up twice)

mostCommonWord(
`It's a blue ball and its shade... Very BLUE!`,
['and']); // blue (it show up twice, "it" and "its" once)
