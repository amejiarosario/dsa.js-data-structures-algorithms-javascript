(((FIFO)))
A queue is a linear data structure where the data flows in a *First-In-First-Out* (FIFO) manner.

.Queue data structure is like a line of people: the First-in, is the First-out

A queue is like a line of people at the bank; the person who arrived first is the first to go out.

Similar to the stack, we only have two operations (insert and remove). In a Queue, we add elements to the back of the list and remove it from the front.

We could use an array or a linked list to implement a Queue. However, it is recommended only to use a linked list. Why? An array has a linear runtime _O(n)_ to remove an element from the start, while a linked list has constant time _O(1)_.

include::{codedir}/data-structures/queues/queue.js[tag=constructor]
  // ... methods go here ...
}

We initialize the Queue creating a linked list. Now, let’s add the `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods.

==== Insertion
(((Enqueue)))
For inserting elements into a queue, also know as *enqueue*, we add items to the back of the list using `addLast`:

.Queue's enqueue
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/queues/queue.js[tag=enqueue, indent=0]
----

As discussed, this operation has a constant runtime.

==== Deletion
(((Dequeue)))
For removing elements from a queue, also known as *dequeue*, we remove elements from the front of the list using `removeFirst`:

.Queue's dequeue
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/queues/queue.js[tag=dequeue, indent=0]
----

As discussed, this operation has a constant runtime.

==== Implementation usage

We can use our Queue class as follows:

.Queue usage example
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/queues/queue.js[tag=snippet, indent=0]
----

You can see that the items are dequeued in the same order they were added, FIFO (first-in, first-out).

==== Queue Complexity

As an experiment, we can see in the following table that if we had implemented the Queue using an array, its enqueue time would be _O(n)_ instead of _O(1)_. Check it out:

// tag::queue-q-recent-counter[]
===== Recent Counter

*QU-1*) _Design a class that counts the most recent requests within a time window._

Example:

[source, javascript]
----
const counter = new RecentCounter(10); // The time window is 10 ms.
counter.request(1000); // 1 (first request, it always counts)
counter.request(3000); // 1 (last requests was 2000 ms ago, > 10ms, so doesn't count)
counter.request(3100); // 1 (last requests was 100 ms ago, > 10ms, so doesn't count)
counter.request(3105); // 2 (last requests was 5 ms ago, <= 10ms, so it counts)

===== Design Snake Game

*QU-2*) _Design the `move` function for the snake game. The move function returns an integer representing the current score. If the snake goes out of the given height and width or hit itself return `-1` for a game over._
