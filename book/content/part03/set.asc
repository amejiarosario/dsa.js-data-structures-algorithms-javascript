[[set]]
=== Set
(((Set)))
(((Data Structures, Non-Linear, Set)))
A set is a data structure where duplicated entries are not allowed. Set is like an array with unique values.

NOTE: JavaScript has already a built-in Set data structure.

Take a look at the following
example:

.Set usage example (using JavaScript built-in Set)
[source, javascript]
----
const set = new Set();

set.add(1); //↪️ Set [ 1 ]
set.add(1); //↪️ Set [ 1 ]
set.add(2); //↪️ Set [ 1, 2 ]
set.add(3); //↪️ Set [ 1, 2, 3 ]
set.has(1); //↪️ true
set.delete(1); //↪️ removes 1 from the set
set.has(1);    //↪️ false, 1 has been removed
set.size; //↪️ 2, we just removed one value
console.log(set); //↪️ Set(2) {2, 3}
----

As you can see, even if we insert the same value multiple times, it only gets added once.

Can you think in a way how to implement it?

TIP: A hint... it should perform all operations in *O(1)** or at most *O(log n)*

If we use a `map`, we can accomplish this. However, maps use a key/value pair. If we only use the keys, we can avoid duplicates. Since in a `map` you can only have one key at a time.

As you might remember from the <<part03-graph-data-structures#map>> chapter, there are two ways of implementing a `map` and both can be used to create a `set`.  Let's explore the difference between the two implementations are.

==== HashSet vs TreeSet

We can implement a `map` using a *balanced BST* and using a *hash function*. If we use them to implement a `Set`, then we would have a `HashSet` and `TreeSet` respectively.

* `TreeSet`, would return the values sorted in ascending order.
* `HashSet`, would return the values in insertion order.
* Operations on a `HashSet` would take on average O(1) and in the worst case (rehash is due), it would take O(n).
* Operation on a `TreeSet` is always O(log n).

Let’s implement both!

[[tree-set]]
==== TreeSet
(((TreeSet)))
(((Data Structures, Non-Linear, TreeSet)))
We are to use a self-balanced BST (Red-Black Tree) to implement TreeSet.

.TreeSet's constructor method and size attribute
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/sets/tree-set.js[tag=constructor]
}
----
<1> Converts an array or any iterable data structure to a set.

A common use case for Sets is to remove duplicated values from an array. We can do that by passing them in the constructor as follows:

.Removing duplicates from an Array using a Set
[source, javascript]
----
set = new TreeSet([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]);
expect(set.size).toBe(3);
expect(Array.from(set.keys())).toEqual([1, 2, 3]);
----

Ok, now let’s implement the add method.

===== Adding elements to a TreeSet

For adding values to the set, we `Tree.add` method.

.TreeSet's constructor method and size attribute
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/sets/tree-set.js[tag=add,indent=0]
----

Our <<Inserting new elements in a BST, BST implementation>> can hold duplicated values. It has a multiplicity tally to keep track of duplicates. However, we don’t dupe in a set. For that, we check if the value is already in the tree.
Don’t worry about adding extra lookups. The
`Tree.has` is also very performant *O(log n)*.

===== Searching for values in a TreeSet

Again, we rely on the Tree implementation to do the heavy lifting:

.TreeSet's `has` method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/sets/tree-set.js[tag=has, indent=0]
----

===== Deleting elements from a TreeSet

We delete the elements from the TreeSet using the remove method of the BST.

.TreeSet's `delete` method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/sets/tree-set.js[tag=delete, indent=0]
----

Voilà! That’s it!

===== Converting TreeSet to Array

A common use case for a Set is to convert it to an array or use in an iterator (for loops, forEach, …). Let’s provide the method for that:

.TreeSet's iterator
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/sets/tree-set.js[tag=iterator, indent=0]
----

We are using the `inOrderTraversal` method of the BST to go each key in an
ascending order.

.JavaScript Built-in `Symbol` iterator
****
The `Symbol.iterator` built-in symbol specifies the default iterator for
an object. Used by `for...of`, `Array.from` and others.
****

Now we can convert from set to array and vice versa easily. For
instance:

.TreeSet's iterator
[source, javascript]
----
const array = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5];

// array to set
const set = new TreeSet(array);

// set to array
Array.from(set); //↪️ (4) [1, 2, 3, 5]
----

No more duplicates in our array!

Let’s now, implement a `HashSet`.

[[hashset]]
==== HashSet
(((HashSet)))
(((Data Structures, Non-Linear, HashSet)))
The *HashSet* is the set implementation using a HashMap as its underlying data structure.

The HashSet interface will be the same as the built-in `Set` or our previously implemented `TreeSet`.

.HashSet's constructor method and size attribute
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/sets/hash-set.js[tag=constructor]
}
----

This constructor is useful for converting an array to set and initializing the `HashMap`.

===== Inserting values to a HashSet

To insert items in a HashSet we use the `set` method of the `HashMap`:

.HashSet's `add` method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/sets/hash-set.js[tag=add, indent=0]
}
----

`HashMap` stores key/value pairs, but for this, we only need the key, and we ignore the value.

===== Finding values in a HashSet

We use the method `has` to check if a value is on the `Set` or not.

.HashSet's `has` method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/sets/hash-set.js[tag=has, indent=0]
----

Internally, the `HashMap` will convert the key into an array index using a hash function. If there’s something in the array index bucket, it will return
true, and if it’s empty, it will be false.

===== Deleting values from a HashSet

For deleting a value from a hashSet we use the HashMap’s delete method:

.HashSet's `delete` method
[source, javascript]
----
include::{codedir}/data-structures/sets/hash-set.js[tag=delete, indent=0]
----

This method has an average runtime of *O(1)*.

==== HashSet vs HashMap Time Complexity

We can say that `HashMap` in on average more performant O(1) vs. O(log n). However, if a
rehash happens, it will take *O(n)* instead of *O(1)*. A `TreeSet` is always *O(log n)*.

To recap, HashSet and TreeSet will keep data without duplicates. The
difference besides runtime is that:

.TreeSet vs HashSet
* HashSet keeps data in insertion order
* TreeSet keeps data sorted in ascending order.
