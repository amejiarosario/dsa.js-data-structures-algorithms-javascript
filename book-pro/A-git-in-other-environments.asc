== Git in Other Environments

If you read through the whole book, you've learned a lot about how to use Git at the command line.

But the story doesn't end there; Git is usually used as part of a larger ecosystem, and the terminal isn't always the best way to work with it.
Now we'll take a look at some of the other kinds of environments where Git can be useful, and how other applications (including yours) work alongside Git.
