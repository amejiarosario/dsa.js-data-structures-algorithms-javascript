=== Map
(((Map)))
(((Data Structures, Non-Linear, Map)))
A map is a data structure to store pairs of data: *key* and *value*. In an array, you can only store values. The array’s key is always the position index. However, in a *Map* the key can be whatever you want.

IMPORTANT: Map is a data structure that _maps_ *keys* to *values*.

Many languages have maps already built-in. JavaScript/Node has `Map`:

In short, you set `key`/`value` pair and then you can get the `value` using the `key`.

The attractive part of Maps is that they are very performant usually *O(1)* or *O(log n)* depending on the implementation. We can implement the maps using two different underlying data structures:

* *HashMap*: it’s a map implementation using an *array* and a *hash function*. The job of the hash function is to convert the `key` into an index that maps to the `value`. Optimized HashMap can have an average runtime of *O(1)*.
* *TreeMap*: it’s a map implementation that uses a self-balanced Binary Search Tree (like <<AVL Tree>>). The BST nodes store the key, and the value and nodes are sorted by key guaranteeing an *O(log n)* look up.

==== HashMap vs TreeMap

.A map can be implemented using hash functions or binary search tree:
- *HashMap*: it’s a map implementation using an *array* and *hash function*. The job of the hash function is to convert the key into an index that contains the matching data. Optimized HashMap can have an average runtime of *O(1)*.
- *TreeMap*: it’s a map implementation that uses a self-balanced Binary Search Tree (red-black tree). The BST nodes store the key, and the value and nodes are sorted by key guaranteeing an *O(log n)* look up.


.When to use a TreeMap vs. HashMap?
* `HashMap` is more time-efficient. A `TreeMap` is more space-efficient.
* `TreeMap` search complexity is *O(log n)*, while an optimized `HashMap` is *O(1)* on average. 
* `HashMap`’s keys are in insertion order (or random depending in the implementation). `TreeMap`’s keys are always sorted.
* `TreeMap` offers some statistical data for free such as: get minimum, get maximum, median, find ranges of keys. `HashMap` doesn’t.
* `TreeMap` has a guarantee always an *O(log n)*, while `HashMap`s has an amortized time of *O(1)* but in the rare case of a rehash, it would take an *O(n)*.

===== TreeMap Time complexity vs HashMap

As we discussed so far, there is a trade-off between the implementations.
