[[_plumbing_porcelain]]
=== Plumbing and Porcelain

This book covers primarily how to use Git with 30 or so subcommands such as `checkout`, `branch`, `remote`, and so on.
But because Git was initially a toolkit for a version control system rather than a full user-friendly VCS, it has a number of subcommands that do low-level work and were designed to be chained together UNIX-style or called from scripts.
These commands are generally referred to as Git's ``plumbing'' commands, while the more user-friendly commands are called ``porcelain'' commands.

As you will have noticed by now, this book's first nine chapters deal almost exclusively with porcelain commands.
But in this chapter, you'll be dealing mostly with the lower-level plumbing commands, because they give you access to the inner workings of Git, and help demonstrate how and why Git does what it does.
Many of these commands aren't meant to be used manually on the command line, but rather to be used as building blocks for new tools and custom scripts.

When you run `git init` in a new or existing directory, Git creates the `.git` directory, which is where almost everything that Git stores and manipulates is located.
If you want to back up or clone your repository, copying this single directory elsewhere gives you nearly everything you need.
This entire chapter basically deals with what you can see in this directory.
Here's what a newly-initialized `.git` directory typically looks like:

[source,console]
----
$ ls -F1
config
description
HEAD
hooks/
info/
objects/
refs/
----

Depending on your version of Git, you may see some additional content there, but this is a fresh `git init` repository -- it's what you see by default.
The `description` file is used only by the GitWeb program, so don't worry about it.
The `config` file contains your project-specific configuration options, and the `info` directory keeps a global exclude file (((excludes))) for ignored patterns that you don't want to track in a `.gitignore` file.
The `hooks` directory contains your client- or server-side hook scripts, which are discussed in detail in <<ch08-customizing-git#_git_hooks>>.

This leaves four important entries: the `HEAD` and (yet to be created) `index` files, and the `objects` and `refs` directories.
These are the core parts of Git.
The `objects` directory stores all the content for your database, the `refs` directory stores pointers into commit objects in that data (branches, tags, remotes and more), the `HEAD` file points to the branch you currently have checked out, and the `index` file is where Git stores your staging area information.
You'll now look at each of these sections in detail to see how Git operates.
