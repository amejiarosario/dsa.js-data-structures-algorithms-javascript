=== Environment Variables

Git always runs inside a `bash` shell, and uses a number of shell environment variables to determine how it behaves.
Occasionally, it comes in handy to know what these are, and how they can be used to make Git behave the way you want it to.
This isn't an exhaustive list of all the environment variables Git pays attention to, but we'll cover the most useful.


==== Global Behavior

Some of Git's general behavior as a computer program depends on environment variables.

*`GIT_EXEC_PATH`* determines where Git looks for its sub-programs (like `git-commit`, `git-diff`, and others).
  You can check the current setting by running `git --exec-path`.

*`HOME`* isn't usually considered customizable (too many other things depend on it), but it's where Git looks for the global configuration file.
  If you want a truly portable Git installation, complete with global configuration, you can override `HOME` in the portable Git's shell profile.

*`PREFIX`* is similar, but for the system-wide configuration.
  Git looks for this file at `$PREFIX/etc/gitconfig`.

*`GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`*, if set, disables the use of the system-wide configuration file.
  This is useful if your system config is interfering with your commands, but you don't have access to change or remove it.

*`GIT_PAGER`* controls the program used to display multi-page output on the command line.
If this is unset, `PAGER` will be used as a fallback.

*`GIT_EDITOR`* is the editor Git will launch when the user needs to edit some text (a commit message, for example).
If unset, `EDITOR` will be used.


==== Repository Locations

Git uses several environment variables to determine how it interfaces with the current repository.

*`GIT_DIR`* is the location of the `.git` folder.
If this isn't specified, Git walks up the directory tree until it gets to `~` or `/`, looking for a `.git` directory at every step.

*`GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`* controls the behavior of searching for a `.git` directory.
If you access directories that are slow to load (such as those on a tape drive, or across a slow network connection), you may want to have Git stop trying earlier than it might otherwise, especially if Git is invoked when building your shell prompt.

*`GIT_WORK_TREE`* is the location of the root of the working directory for a non-bare repository.
If `--git-dir` or `GIT_DIR` is specified but none of `--work-tree`, `GIT_WORK_TREE` or `core.worktree` is specified, the current working directory is regarded as the top level of your working tree.

*`GIT_INDEX_FILE`* is the path to the index file (non-bare repositories only).

*`GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`* can be used to specify the location of the directory that usually resides at `.git/objects`.

*`GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`* is a colon-separated list (formatted like `/dir/one:/dir/two:…`) which tells Git where to check for objects if they aren't in `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`.
If you happen to have a lot of projects with large files that have the exact same contents, this can be used to avoid storing too many copies of them.


==== Pathspecs

A ``pathspec'' refers to how you specify paths to things in Git, including the use of wildcards.
These are used in the `.gitignore` file, but also on the command-line (`git add *.c`).

*`GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS`* and *`GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS`* control the default behavior of wildcards in pathspecs.
If `GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS` is set to 1, wildcard characters act as wildcards (which is the default); if `GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS` is set to 1, wildcard characters only match themselves, meaning something like `*.c` would only match a file _named_ ``*.c'', rather than any file whose name ends with `.c`.
You can override this in individual cases by starting the pathspec with `:(glob)` or `:(literal)`, as in `:(glob)*.c`.

*`GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS`* disables both of the above behaviors; no wildcard characters will work, and the override prefixes are disabled as well.

*`GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS`* sets all pathspecs to work in a case-insensitive manner.


==== Committing

The final creation of a Git commit object is usually done by `git-commit-tree`, which uses these environment variables as its primary source of information, falling back to configuration values only if these aren't present.

*`GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`* is the human-readable name in the ``author'' field.

*`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`* is the email for the ``author'' field.

*`GIT_AUTHOR_DATE`* is the timestamp used for the ``author'' field.

*`GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`* sets the human name for the ``committer'' field.

*`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`* is the email address for the ``committer'' field.

*`GIT_COMMITTER_DATE`* is used for the timestamp in the ``committer'' field.

*`EMAIL`* is the fallback email address in case the `user.email` configuration value isn't set.
If _this_ isn't set, Git falls back to the system user and host names.


==== Networking

Git uses the `curl` library to do network operations over HTTP, so *`GIT_CURL_VERBOSE`* tells Git to emit all the messages generated by that library.
This is similar to doing `curl -v` on the command line.

*`GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY`* tells Git not to verify SSL certificates.
This can sometimes be necessary if you're using a self-signed certificate to serve Git repositories over HTTPS, or you're in the middle of setting up a Git server but haven't installed a full certificate yet.


If the data rate of an HTTP operation is lower than *`GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT`* bytes per second for longer than *`GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME`* seconds, Git will abort that operation.
These values override the `http.lowSpeedLimit` and `http.lowSpeedTime` configuration values.

*`GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT`* sets the user-agent string used by Git when communicating over HTTP.
The default is a value like `git/2.0.0`.


==== Diffing and Merging

*`GIT_DIFF_OPTS`* is a bit of a misnomer.
The only valid values are `-u<n>` or `--unified=<n>`, which controls the number of context lines shown in a `git diff` command.

*`GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`* is used as an override for the `diff.external` configuration value.
If it's set, Git will invoke this program when `git diff` is invoked.

*`GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER`* and *`GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL`* are useful from inside the program specified by `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` or `diff.external`.
The former represents which file in a series is being diffed (starting with 1), and the latter is the total number of files in the batch.

*`GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY`* controls the output for the recursive merge strategy.
The allowed values are as follows:

* 0 outputs nothing, except possibly a single error message.
* 1 shows only conflicts.
* 2 also shows file changes.
* 3 shows when files are skipped because they haven't changed.
* 4 shows all paths as they are processed.
* 5 and above show detailed debugging information.

The default value is 2.

==== Debugging

Want to _really_ know what Git is up to?
Git has a fairly complete set of traces embedded, and all you need to do is turn them on.
The possible values of these variables are as follows:

* ``true'', ``1'', or ``2'' – the trace category is written to stderr.
* An absolute path starting with `/` – the trace output will be written to that file.

*`GIT_TRACE`* controls general traces, which don't fit into any specific category.
This includes the expansion of aliases, and delegation to other sub-programs.

==== Miscellaneous

*`GIT_SSH`*, if specified, is a program that is invoked instead of `ssh` when Git tries to connect to an SSH host.
It is invoked like `$GIT_SSH [username@]host [-p <port>] <command>`.
Note that this isn't the easiest way to customize how `ssh` is invoked; it won't support extra command-line parameters, so you'd have to write a wrapper script and set `GIT_SSH` to point to it.
It's probably easier just to use the `~/.ssh/config` file for that.

*`GIT_ASKPASS`* is an override for the `core.askpass` configuration value.
This is the program invoked whenever Git needs to ask the user for credentials, which can expect a text prompt as a command-line argument, and should return the answer on `stdout`.
(See <<ch07-git-tools#_credential_caching>> for more on this subsystem.)

*`GIT_NAMESPACE`* controls access to namespaced refs, and is equivalent to the `--namespace` flag.
This is mostly useful on the server side, where you may want to store multiple forks of a single repository in one repository, only keeping the refs separate.

*`GIT_FLUSH`* can be used to force Git to use non-buffered I/O when writing incrementally to stdout.
A value of 1 causes Git to flush more often, a value of 0 causes all output to be buffered.
The default value (if this variable is not set) is to choose an appropriate buffering scheme depending on the activity and the output mode.

*`GIT_REFLOG_ACTION`* lets you specify the descriptive text written to the reflog.
Here's an example:

[source,console]
----
$ GIT_REFLOG_ACTION="my action" git commit --allow-empty -m 'my message'
[master 9e3d55a] my message
$ git reflog -1
9e3d55a HEAD@{0}: my action: my message
