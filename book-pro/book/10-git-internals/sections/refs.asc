=== Git References

If you were interested in seeing the history of your repository reachable from commit, say, `1a410e`, you could run something like `git log 1a410e` to display that history, but you would still have to remember that `1a410e` is the commit you want to use as the starting point for that history.
Instead, it would be easier if you had a file in which you could store that SHA-1 value under a simple name so you could use that simple name rather than the raw SHA-1 value.

In Git, these simple names are called ``references'' or ``refs''; you can find the files that contain those SHA-1 values in the `.git/refs` directory.
In the current project, this directory contains no files, but it does contain a simple structure:

[source,console]
----
$ find .git/refs
.git/refs
.git/refs/heads
.git/refs/tags
$ find .git/refs -type f
----

To create a new reference that will help you remember where your latest commit is, you can technically do something as simple as this:

[source,console]
----
$ echo 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9 > .git/refs/heads/master
----

Now, you can use the head reference you just created instead of the SHA-1 value in your Git commands:

[source,console]
----
$ git log --pretty=oneline master
1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9 third commit
cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d second commit
fdf4fc3344e67ab068f836878b6c4951e3b15f3d first commit
----

You aren't encouraged to directly edit the reference files; instead, Git provides the safer command `git update-ref` to do this if you want to update a reference:

[source,console]
----
$ git update-ref refs/heads/master 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9
----

That's basically what a branch in Git is: a simple pointer or reference to the head of a line of work.
To create a branch back at the second commit, you can do this:

[source,console]
----
$ git update-ref refs/heads/test cac0ca
----

Your branch will contain only work from that commit down:

[source,console]
----
$ git log --pretty=oneline test
cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d second commit
fdf4fc3344e67ab068f836878b6c4951e3b15f3d first commit
----

Now, your Git database conceptually looks something like this:

.Git directory objects with branch head references included.

When you run commands like `git branch <branch>`, Git basically runs that `update-ref` command to add the SHA-1 of the last commit of the branch you're on into whatever new reference you want to create.

==== The HEAD

The question now is, when you run `git branch <branch>`, how does Git know the SHA-1 of the last commit?
The answer is the HEAD file.

Usually the HEAD file is a symbolic reference to the branch you're currently on.
By symbolic reference, we mean that unlike a normal reference, it contains a pointer to another reference.

However in some rare cases the HEAD file may contain the SHA-1 value of a git object.
This happens when you checkout a tag, commit, or remote branch, which puts your repository in https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#_detached_head["detached HEAD"] state.

If you look at the file, you'll normally see something like this:

[source,console]
----
$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
----

If you run `git checkout test`, Git updates the file to look like this:

[source,console]
----
$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/test
----

When you run `git commit`, it creates the commit object, specifying the parent of that commit object to be whatever SHA-1 value the reference in HEAD points to.

You can also manually edit this file, but again a safer command exists to do so: `git symbolic-ref`.
You can read the value of your HEAD via this command:

[source,console]
----
$ git symbolic-ref HEAD
refs/heads/master
----

You can also set the value of HEAD using the same command:

[source,console]
----
$ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/test
$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/test
----

You can't set a symbolic reference outside of the refs style:

[source,console]
----
$ git symbolic-ref HEAD test
fatal: Refusing to point HEAD outside of refs/
----

==== Tags

We just finished discussing Git's three main object types (_blobs_, _trees_ and _commits_), but there is a fourth.
The _tag_ object is very much like a commit object -- it contains a tagger, a date, a message, and a pointer.
The main difference is that a tag object generally points to a commit rather than a tree.
It's like a branch reference, but it never moves -- it always points to the same commit but gives it a friendlier name.

As discussed in <<ch02-git-basics-chapter#ch02-git-basics-chapter>>, there are two types of tags: annotated and lightweight.
You can make a lightweight tag by running something like this:

[source,console]
----
$ git update-ref refs/tags/v1.0 cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d
----

That is all a lightweight tag is -- a reference that never moves.
An annotated tag is more complex, however.
If you create an annotated tag, Git creates a tag object and then writes a reference to point to it rather than directly to the commit.
You can see this by creating an annotated tag (using the `-a` option):

[source,console]
----
$ git tag -a v1.1 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9 -m 'test tag'
----

Here's the object SHA-1 value it created:

[source,console]
----
$ cat .git/refs/tags/v1.1
9585191f37f7b0fb9444f35a9bf50de191beadc2
----

Now, run `git cat-file -p` on that SHA-1 value:

[source,console]
----
$ git cat-file -p 9585191f37f7b0fb9444f35a9bf50de191beadc2
object 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9
type commit
tag v1.1

test tag
----

Notice that the object entry points to the commit SHA-1 value that you tagged.
Also notice that it doesn't need to point to a commit; you can tag any Git object.
In the Git source code, for example, the maintainer has added their GPG public key as a blob object and then tagged it.
You can view the public key by running this in a clone of the Git repository:

[source,console]
----
$ git cat-file blob junio-gpg-pub
----

The Linux kernel repository also has a non-commit-pointing tag object -- the first tag created points to the initial tree of the import of the source code.

==== Remotes

The third type of reference that you'll see is a remote reference.
If you add a remote and push to it, Git stores the value you last pushed to that remote for each branch in the `refs/remotes` directory.
For instance, you can add a remote called `origin` and push your `master` branch to it:

[source,console]
----
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
$ git push origin master
Counting objects: 11, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 716 bytes, done.
Total 7 (delta 2), reused 4 (delta 1)
To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
  a11bef0..ca82a6d  master -> master
----

Then, you can see what the `master` branch on the `origin` remote was the last time you communicated with the server, by checking the `refs/remotes/origin/master` file:

[source,console]
----
$ cat .git/refs/remotes/origin/master
ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949
----

Remote references differ from branches (`refs/heads` references) mainly in that they're considered read-only.
You can `git checkout` to one, but Git won't point HEAD at one, so you'll never update it with a `commit` command.
Git manages them as bookmarks to the last known state of where those branches were on those servers.
